          Hi! I’m Jessica. I am currently a student at the Coding Bootcamp with the University of Washington. I’m also an alumni of the Foster School of Business with a degree in Business Administration. I have a huge passion for fashion. While in college, I started my blog, Missjesf and partnered with brands like COACH and Jord Watches. Since graduating, I’ve focused on my career while blogging on the side. I stayed on with Nordstrom after my internship learning the ins-and-outs of retail before taking on a role as a stylist with Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe at Amazon. As the retail industry shifts to online, I hope to expand my knowledge both online and offline.

          In my free time, I enjoy window shopping to learn new trends and finding inspiration. I also enjoy trying new restaurants and traveling. Some of my favorite destinations have been Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong.
